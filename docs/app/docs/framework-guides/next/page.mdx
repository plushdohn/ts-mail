# Next.js

In general for Next.js you can follow the same approach as for your runtime (probably [Node.js](/docs/framework-guides/node)), but you need to make sure the `.md` files are included in the final bundled folder.

The easiest way to do this is placing the .md files in the `public` folder, and then reading them from there.

## Importing as raw text

If you want to go for a bit of a fancier setup and be able to import markdown files directly like so:

```ts
import welcomeEmail from "./welcomeEmail.md";
```

you can configure Next to handle markdown files as raw text by adding a rule to your `next.config.js` that makes `.md` files be handled as assets.

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.md$/,
      // This is the asset module.
      type: "asset/source",
    });
    return config;
  },
};
```

If you're using TypeScript, you must also add this declaration to a `global.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare module "*.md";
```
