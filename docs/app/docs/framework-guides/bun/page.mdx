# Bun

If you're using Bun as the runtime for your untranspiled code (or using `bun build`), you can directly import asset files as raw text using import macros:

```ts
import welcomeEmail from './welcomeEmail.md' with { type: "text" };

const email = await buildEmail({
  markdown: welcomeEmail,
  subject: "Welcome to our app",
});
```

## Fallback to file IO

If this approach is giving you problems you can always fall back to reading from the file system, either with Bun APIs or Node.js fs:

With Bun APIs:

```ts
const email = await buildEmail({
  markdown: await Bun.file("./welcomeEmail.md").text(),
  subject: "Welcome to our app",
});
```

With Node.js fs:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";

const email = await buildEmail({
  markdown: fs.readFileSync("./welcomeEmail.md", "utf-8"),
  subject: "Welcome to our app",
});
```
