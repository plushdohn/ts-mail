# Node.js

For Node.js you can use the `fs` module to read the markdown file:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";

const email = await buildEmail({
  markdown: fs.readFileSync("./welcomeEmail.md", "utf-8"),
  subject: "Welcome to our app",
});
```

For this to work, you need to make sure the markdown file is included in the server where Node is running.

If you're using a bundler like Rollup, Vite or Webpack, you can configure those to copy the markdown file to the output folder, or even better use `import` loaders.

Same applies if you're using Docker, you need to make sure the markdown file is included in the final image.
