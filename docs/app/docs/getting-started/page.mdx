# Getting started

### Installation

ts-mail can be installed in any environment (browsers included) as a single npm package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i ts-mail
```

That's it! âœ¨

### Basic usage

You can now use ts-mail to generate HTML emails like this:

```ts
import { buildEmail } from "ts-mail";

const email = await buildEmail({
  markdown: "Hello *{{name}}*",
  subject: "Hello",
  data: {
    name: "John",
  },
});

// Generated HTML document
console.log(email.html);

// Text-only version of the email
console.log(email.text);
```

### Builder

You typically want to share some options between the different emails in your app (layout options, styling, footer, etc.).

ts-mail provides an API to make this more conveient, by defining an email **builder** and using that to build emails.

```ts
import { createEmailBuilder } from "ts-mail";

/**
 * All the emails created with this will have
 * the same footer and a black background
 */
const emails = createEmailBuilder({
  styles: {
    document: {
      backgroundColor: "black",
    },
  },
  footer: "Acme Corp LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043",
});

const email = await emails.build({
  markdown: "Hello *{{name}}*",
  subject: "Hello",
  data: {
    name: "John",
  },
});
```
